> App that shows the current location of the International Space Station on a map. Uses fetch to get the station's location and the google map's api to mark it on a map. It also fetches and displays the number of humans currently in space as well as their names and the craft they are on.

## Details

While building this app I've used the following languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

Amongst others, I focused on showing an understanding of these concepts:

* Using Bootstrap to style the app.
* Handling multiple API calls.
* Using fetch.
* Using promises to perform asynchronous tasks. 
* Handling the Date object to display a live clock in the final app.
